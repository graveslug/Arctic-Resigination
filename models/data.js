Will we enslave our computers like our gods enslave us or will we reach out with kindness and openess to create a symboisis between human and machine."

    "description": "From the depths of the Hive District comes the voices of Muscle and Machine that reflect on what it was like to have a living body in a time before we all chose to embrace the synthetic self. It asks why we pained ourselves with death. Why attack each other for the flesh we were given - not chosen. Why we care so much about what we look like and not what we can do. Why for 1000's of years we were convinced death is normal and not a disease."

    "description": "This technical masterpiece of post-Blackened Metalgaze brings us to contemplate why we struggle deeply with idenity in a world of flesh. Why those of skin attack us for giving up our 'idenities' to take a body that is designed by ourselves for our own needs. It asks why we should struggle with borned bodies that constantly fail with little ability to fix them. It speaks that the belief of The Ship of Theseus is a construct meant to stagnate ones growth. It measures a person by their flesh and physical ability - not their achievements and mental prowness. A body is a vessel for the brain to be driven for its needs. Nothing more. Let go of your idenity and you achieve the freedom to be present with your curosity. Follow those threads and you will see that life is more than the vessel we live in."

    "description": "Depressive Suicidal Black Metal at its best. It grips to the agony of eternal life. The constant fight of not being able to unplug ourselves from the everlasting onslaught of information and chaos of our simulations. It asks what price have we paid to live forever when we reach the point of sitting in the void replaying our lives of flesh that will ultimately lead to restarting the universe over and over again. Each death we awaken and see ourselves in binary reflecting on this life compared to that life before we go back into the simulation because the world outside of the cube is meaningless. It doesn't exist. We outlived it all and now we only have ourselves. It asks how many lives and emotions must I go through until I no longer have to repeat these lives. I've killed myself, I've killed others, I felt degrees of emotion through torture and love. What else could I ever feel? The simulation creates all and we did it to ourselves."

    "description": "This brilliant Depressive Post Rock band called Old Friends reached out to us for the longing of a dear friend, lover, wishing that they were still alive. The sorrow of seeing our friends choose a life of flesh and the death of a human while we chose to go to the synthetic bodies. It draws our attention to sitting in a hospital, holding the old dying hands of the people we love. So many deaths repeated. So much sorrow to carry for years. There is no pain then losing a friend of 100 years to age but that is the beauty in it. It calls to respect that process, to let go of life because it is understandable that sometimes...you just don't want to go on. Rest well my friends. I still think of you."

    "description": "This GrindCore cult band releases another flesh-hating chaos slaughter house towards the human body. It follows the themes of starvation, sex, violence, permanent death, self mulitlation, with the cacophoney of noise into the marrow of people that fear the synthetic machine. This band is noisey and fearsome in the underground. They have been known to create riots, bloodbaths, and drive the point home that the body is disgusting in all its functions and serve no actual purpose for our needs. Let go of the mortal flesh and embrace the machine gods!"
